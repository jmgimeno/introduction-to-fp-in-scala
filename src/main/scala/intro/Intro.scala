  * There are two important questions:
  *  - what is functional programming? (10 minutes)
  *  - why do we care?                 (10 years)

 /*
  * functional programming is programming with functions....
  */































 /*
  * What is a function?
  *
  *   A function relates every set of arguments to a result and does
  *   _nothing_ else.
  *
  *   This means if you pass the _same_ arguments, you must get the
  *   _same_ result.

 /*
  * This gives us equational reasoning. This is what is
  * meant by can we "reason" about this code. It does not
  * imply that your code is good or bad, just that either
  * way we have a really effective tool to help us understand
  * and modify the code with out fear.
  */

































 /*
  * This really is it. Everything else is sugar (or vinegar
  * depending on your perspective). At times things may seem
  * obtuse, but I ask you to suspend any disbelief, all we are
  * trying to do is approach programming with functions in a
  * pervasive fashion.
  *
  * The rest of the exercises will start to give you an idea of
  * what this is like, it will show how using types can assist,
  * and hopefully start to give you an idea of why functional
  * programming.
